* Add a possibility to always use either wget or curl, not both! 

* Fix NMW errors:
wcs_Cyg5_2021-10-16_19-25-12_003.fts: broken symbolic link to local_wcs_cache/wcs_Cyg5_2021-10-16_19-25-12_003.fts


* Test with bad images
./diffphot /mnt/usb/MSU_Obs/2021_09_30/alternative_mffC_morning/fd_TOI2025_C_10sec_run01-*.fit
default.sex 10 10 10

* For file already exist in ms and md add check that the directory is actually writable.

* Add ZTF periodic variables catalog support
http://variables.cn:88/ztf/
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...18C/abstract

* Test if the input image is blank (no noise, no stars)

* Fix the rounding error in date coversion 
util/get_image_date 2020-07-15.841 != 2459046.340995
util/get_image_date 2020-08-05.271 != 2459066.770995

* Add support for "bias + scaled dark" CCD image calibration strategy

* A NOVAS-based routine that would compute geocentric J2000 positions of major planets.
(This is for quickly identifying bright transient candidates, so no need for high positional accuracy.)

* On fresh install the VSX catalog update is slow and silent.
Need to inform the user about what is going on!

* Specify image center for plate solver.

* Write warning in sextract_single_image that with the default settings 
a measurement will be dropped.

* Make sure to go to another period search server if the first one didn't work.

* Do a range check for all STAR*[Pos*[i]]

* Transfer to double-precision star positions

* First try to plate-solve with guessed coordinates and retry without them if failed...

* Support long filenames in ./lc display.

* Print amplitude in ./lc display.

* Do not try to guess gain if 'photocurve' is used for magnitude calibration???
Unless it is explicitly requested by user.

* inxi may not work (because of lspci for example) - deal with it

* Print error message when requested to convert from TT back to UTC.

* Single-image cosmic ray/hot pixel filter?

* Image arithmetics with floating point images

* util/ccd/mk - do robust sigma-clipping before MEDIAN-combining images???

* Ignore JD keyword if there is a comment "/Julian Date at start of exposure"

* Test on linux Mint

* Test CFITSIO after building

* Correct for differential extinction/flat-fielding problems while performing
absolute magnitude calibration using APASS.

* Make sure the narrow-field CCD test images can be plate-solved automatically

* Need support for sub-second timing in DATE-OBS. So far we are rounding to
1 sec due to the definition of struct tm (int tm_sec)
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Broken_002ddown-Time.html

* Print "unknown key" message in lc and find_candidates

* Even more clear interpretation of the command line

* ZScale image scaling in pgfv???
